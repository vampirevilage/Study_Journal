<h1 style="color: red;">Classification of patterns</h1>

<p>The most basic and low-level patterns are often called <i>idioms</i>. They usually apply only to a single programming language.</p>

<p>The most universal and high-level patterns are <i>architectural patterns</i>. Developers can implement these patterns in virtually any language. Unlike other patterns, they can be used to design the architecture of an entire application.</p>

<p>In addition, all patterns can be categorized by their <i>intent</i>, or purpose. The three main groups of patterns: </p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Creational patterns</b> provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.</li>
    <li><b>Structural patterns</b> explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping the structures flexible and efficient.</li>
    <li><b>Behavioral patterns</b> take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="green"><b>Gang of Four Design Patterns</b></h2>
<h3 class="green"><b>Creational Design Patterns</b></h3>
<ol>
<li><strong class="green">Abstract Factory</strong> Allows the creation of objects without specifying their concrete type.</li>
<li><strong class="green">Builder</strong> Uses to create complex objects.</li>
<li><strong class="green">Factory Method</strong> Creates objects without specifying the exact class to create.</li>
<li><strong class="green">Prototype</strong> Creates a new object from an existing object.</li>
<li><strong class="green">Singleton</strong> Ensures only one instance of an object is created.</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="green"><b>Structural Design Patterns</b></h3>
<ol>
<li><b>Adapter</b> Allows for two incompatible classes to work together by wrapping an interface around one of the existing classes.</li>
<li><b>Bridge</b> Decouples an abstraction so two classes can vary independently.</li>
<li><b>Composite</b> Takes a group of objects into a single object.</li>
<li><b>Decorator</b> Allows for an object’s behavior to be extended dynamically at run time.</li>
<li><b>Facade</b> Provides a simple interface to a more complex underlying object.</li>
<li><b>Flyweight</b> Reduces the cost of complex object models.</li>
<li><b>Proxy</b> Provides a placeholder interface to an underlying object to control access, reduce cost, or reduce complexity.</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="green"><b>Behavior Design Patterns</b></h3>
<ol>
<li><b>Chain of Responsibility</b> Delegates commands to a chain of processing objects.</li>
<li><b>Command</b> Creates objects which encapsulate actions and parameters.</li>
<li><b>Interpreter</b> Implements a specialized language.</li>
<li><b>Iterator</b> Accesses the elements of an object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.</li>
<li><b>Mediator</b> Allows loose coupling between classes by being the only class that has detailed knowledge of their methods.</li>
<li><b>Memento</b> Provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state.</li>
<li><b>Observer</b> Is a publish/subscribe pattern which allows a number of observer objects to see an event.</li>
<li><b>State</b> Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.</li>
<li><b>Strategy</b> Allows one of a family of algorithms to be selected on-the-fly at run-time.</li>
<li><b>Template Method</b> Defines the skeleton of an algorithm as an abstract class, allowing its sub-classes to provide concrete behavior.</li>
<li><b>Visitor</b> Separates an algorithm from an object structure by moving the hierarchy of methods into one object.</li>
</ol>
